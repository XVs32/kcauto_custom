### ***E1～E4 map data pack(2024/4/02)*** [***here***](https://github.com/XVs32/kcauto_custom/releases/tag/event_map_pack)  **(A big shout out to [Synexcu](https://github.com/Synexcu), the author of this data pack)**


**[kcauto_custom](https://github.com/XVs32/kcauto_custom)** is a linux customized version of an archived project [kcauto](https://github.com/perryhuynh/kcauto) that includes additional features and functionality.  
In comparison with **kcauto**, **kcauto_custom** is less flexible while being more automatic for easy daily use.  
This tool is designed to help users automate repetitive tasks such as Expedition, Combat, PvP, Repair & Resupply, ultimately saving time and improving efficiency. 

***Warnning*** : kcauto_custom is not made for Windows(althought it could theoretically run on Windows), I might or might not fix any compatibility issues.
